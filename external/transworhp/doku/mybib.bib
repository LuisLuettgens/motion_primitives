  abstract = {The multi-level programming problem is defined as an n-person nonzero-sum
	game with perfect
	
	information in which the players move sequentially. The bi-level linear
	case is addressed in detail. Solutions
	
	are obtained by recasting this problem as a standard mathematical
	probram and appealing to its implicitly
	
	separable structure. The reformulated optimization problem is linear
	save for a ~omplementarity constraint
	
	of the form (a g) = 0. This constraint is decomposed in a manner that
	permits us to achieve separability
	
	with very little cost in dimensionality. A general branch and bound
	algorithm is then applied to obtain
	
	solutions. Unlike the conventional mathematical program though, the
	multi-level program may fail to have a
	
	solution even when the decision variables are defined over a compact
	set. An auxiliary optimization
	
	problem is employed to detect such failure. Finally, the general max-min
	problem is discussed within the
	
	bi-level programming framework. Examples are given for a variety of
	related problems.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional optimal flight trajectories including singular subarcs
	are computed for a single-stage, suborbital hypersonic demonstrator
	system under a new type of constraint. An optimal nominal trajectory
	is permissible only if it offers a prescribed level of safety along
	the total flight path. As an example, the problem of mission abort
	is considered. The flight vehicle has to reach an emergency landing
	site from every point of the nominal ascent trajectory after a total
	failure of the aircraft engine. The mathematical model describing
	the motion of the rocket-powered vehicle is based on the 3D equations
	of motion of a point mass with reference to the spherical rotating
	Earth. Mathematically, the constraint is transformed into a series
	of secondary problems of optimal control. The complete problem can
	be formulated as a boundary value problem for a very large system
	of highly nonlinear differential equations. The safety condition
	is fulfilled pointwise by an adaptive strategy. The numerical solution
	is obtained using the JANUS advanced multiple shooting method. Special
	extensions are necessary to treat the new type of constraint efficiently.
	The demand for full safety in case of mission abort leads to significant
	deformations of the unperturbed trajectory.},
